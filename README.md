# Librarian :books:
 This simple Pytho project is intended mainly as an exercise but also to help me keep track of all the books I own. The program uses a dictionary where the key is a tuple containing the title and author, and the key is a list containing the publisher, year of publishing and locations where the book can be found (in case i own multiple copies of a book).
